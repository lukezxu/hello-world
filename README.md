This is the file I created to get familiar with github. 

Github has a pretty straightforward work flow and is easy to use. I started using it because I'm learning python right now and want to have a platfort to track my progress and document my notes. 

I name this project hello world partially due to the fact that I'm new to github and partially because I'm new to python. 
Later I will create a separate repository to document my learning process of C++.
